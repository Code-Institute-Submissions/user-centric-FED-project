# **Push & Pedal Inc. Website**


## **User-Centric Frontend Development Project - Code Institute**

**&lt;Image mockup website>**

Push & Pedal Inc. is an imaginary company that sells bicycles and wants to have an online presence. The idea was creating a page that could be an  institutional company website to promote their brand, and a base for an e-commerce store.

This project is part one of the four milestone project of Code Institute Full Stack Developer course, and aims to show a responsive website using only HTML5 and CCS3. It also uses the Bootstrap framework and Font Awesome icons for a better layout and user experience.

## **Design Process**
#

### **Strategy Plane:**

The objective of this website is to promote the brand, so was decided to separate it in three main parts: Products, Events and Riders (how athletes 	are called by this company). Due to that, on the strategic plane of this project we thought about how to reinforce that promotion through the website, and that was the starting point.


### **Scope Plane:**


It was decided that some key features need to be attended on this project, where any user could:



*   Any customer could access the website from any device, providing a smooth navigation.
*   Find all products provided by the company
*   Promote their events, since it is a important part of their business
*   Promote their sponsored Riders, as it might be important to some users.
*   Make it easy to get in contact with the company.
*   Provided that company history and goals.

### **Skeleton Plane:**


Developing the wireframes was decided to have a simple website, having one separated page for each key feature the company wanted to promote, and having the more important features also promoted in a specific section in the homepage.

The wireframes were created using XXXXXX(Figma), where the base layout of each page was decided. The main decision at this stage was to use Cards on some pages that could be rearranged depending on the screen size. 

**Wireframes**:

Mobile

Tablet

Laptop / Desktop 

IMAGE.


### **Surface Plane:**


The color scheme was decided to have an earthy and natural vibe, providing enough contrast to attract the user's attention.

In the typography area, it was decided to use Google Font **Roboto,** as it is already largely used and well accepted by users. In case that font can’t be loaded, the fall back is Sans Serif as it will always be loaded correctly.

The imagery of this web site was collected on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), [Burst](https://burst.shopify.com/) and [Pure Cycles](https://www.purecycles.com/#). The images selected aim to attract users, and set the company feeling as a casual and inviting brand.

On the layout, it was decided to have all page links on the header to make them easily accessible in any part of the website. The navigation links were also added to the Footer, to let the navigation smooth on the mobile view, not needing to scroll all the page up.

The Homepage was divided into sections, each one focuses on promoting the main key features of this project. In the Products, Events and Riders page each content was displayed in a card, so the page can be fully responsive.


## **Features**

### **Content**

The Read.me file was based on Code Institute [readme-template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/readme-template) and the [README.md](https://github.com/jacksheehy15/milestone-project-1) file created by my fellow colleague Jack Sheehy. Thank you so much for the inspiration and help.
